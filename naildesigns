Even the most basic manicure looks like it took a whole lot of effort when you add sparkling 3D nail jewels. “We’re going to be seeing more textured nail art, specifically gel designs that are not only fun to look at but also fun to touch,” says Hailey Cohen a nail artist in Wichita Falls, Texas.

Pick your favorite stone or mix metals, like silver and gold studs. For a more subtle look, adorn a solid-colored manicure with dainty gold pearls.

Jelly Nails
“This look has a Y2K vibe with a futuristic twist,” says California-based nail artist and V Beauty Pure educator Noodle Yess. Reach for a nail polish with a jelly finish like Lights Lacquer Cherry Jelly or go for a set of jelly-tinted press-ons like the Kiss Gel Fantasy Jelly Color Press-Ons. If you’re in a pinch, mix a few drops of your desired nail polish color with clear nail polish to achieve the perfect sheer shade. The fewer coats, the more transparent the effect will be.

Glitter Aura Nails
Aura nails are nothing new… but Honey does have a suggestion to make them glisten: Swap out the chrome of last year for a layer of glitter over the aura designs. “I recommend using UN/DN LAQR in shade Deep Breath, made with a mylar glitter to make your nails pop,” says Honey.

Cat Eye Nails
Cat Eye nails are back in a fresh palette. This spring, experiment with the glittering finish over seasonal colors like pastel yellows and soft, muted blues. If you can’t make a trip to the salon, a simple DIY way to achieve this look is with a magnetic nail polish like the V Beauty Pure Rainbow Cat Eye polish. After coating your nails in the polish, “use a nail magnet to manipulate the particles into any design you’d like,” says Yess.

French Croc
The mob wife trend on TikTok has revived our love for animal print. As much as we love leopard spots, Legend says crocodile-print nails are the most popular choice right now. Rather than painting your entire nail in this bold texture, Legend suggests embossing French tips with the design in earth tones.

This nail design is very technical to paint by hand with traditional polish so Legend recommends using blooming gel (a product that spreads or blooms once it has been placed) for an easier approach. “To begin the design, dot some blooming gel spread out in dashes across your nail bed in a brick pattern — these dashes will spread in a matter of seconds, leaving a pattern with gaps that resembles a crocodile,” says Legend.
