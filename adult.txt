A metallic manicure in one solid color is sure to turn heads. Jamaica-based nail artist Carrie Anna Malcolm used a gold chrome powder to create these lipstick nails. First, she painted on a black gel polish and topcoat, then added the metallic powder, sealing the whole look with the topcoat once again.
